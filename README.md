This is a project where we are trying to recognize(classify) similar pictures
from a dataset, based on the their shape. As shape descriptors we implement the
following methods:

1. pattern spectrum
2. Fourier coefficients (of the contour)
3. Fourier coefficients (of the derivative of the angle at each point of the contour)


This was implemented as a course project of Machine Vision in Technical University of Crete
(2013), thus there is a report in greek only.
